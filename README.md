 # Winvisor
Winvisor is a simple hypervisor designed to run an app in an already running system with ept hooking features.

# Goal 
- The projects' goal of this project is to dive both into kernel development and virtualization technology.
- The technical goal is to act as a research infrastructure for runtime debugging. The current milestone is ept hooking. Maybe I'll expand it for a specific use idk.
